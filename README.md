Change Calculator
----------------
A simple C program that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for any given amount in cents. The program uses US currency denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) and implements a greedy algorithm to minimize the total number of coins used.

The program prompts the user for an amount in cents and outputs the total number of coins needed using the largest possible coins first (25¢ → 10¢ → 5¢ → 1¢).

Example:
Input: 67 cents
Output: 5 coins (2 quarters + 1 dime + 1 nickel + 2 pennies)
